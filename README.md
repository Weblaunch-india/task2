Hello there, team.


#We discovered that the majority of the team encountered issues while using GitHub after evolving your first project.


Git and GitHub are platforms that will greatly enhance your resume and career.


So we want you to spend the entire week learning the following fundamentals:

Discover Git, GitHub, and gitbash.


Discover how to connect GitHub to Vscode and use gitbash.


Learn how to clone and fork a repository.


Learn how to create and assign tasks from issues.


Learn how to make a new branch and merge existing ones.

After merging all of the team branches, learn how to commit and raise a pull request.


We have provided a few videos for your reference; please go through them and conduct your own research.

Pro tip 1: talk about the project in your group, go to a Google meet, have a discussion, and start learning about it. Teamwork is what makes dreams come true.

Pro tip #2: If you copy from Google or someone else, you are deceiving yourself. We anticipate genuine behaviour.
